## Adding Custom Nodes to the Project

Welcome to the project! This guide will walk you through the steps to add custom nodes. Follow these instructions to contribute your custom functionality.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, make a local copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```

Open the cloned repository in your preferred IDE.

### 2. Create a New Node File

Navigate to the `flow_functions` folder in the project directory. Create a new file for your node with the following naming conventions:

- **Name Format:** `your_node_name.js`
- **Rules:**
  - Use lowercase letters
  - Use underscores (`_`) to separate words
  - Do not include numbers in the file name

For example, if you want to create a node for crafting planks, you might name the file `craft_planks.js`.

### 3. Implement the Node

Open your newly created file and implement your node using the following structure:

```javascript
"use strict";

import { bot } from "../main.js";
import { mcData } from "../main.js";

function main(data) {
  try {
    // Check if bot has enough resources
    if (bot.inventory.count(mcData.itemsByName.oak_log.id) >= 1) {
      // Craft planks
      bot.craft(mcData.findItemOrBlockByName("oak_planks").id, 4, 1, (err) => {
        if (err) {
          console.error(err);
          throw err;
        }
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}

export { main };
```

**Key Points:**

- The file must use `"use strict";` at the top.
- Any arguments from the frontend like amounts will be passed as first argument to the `main` function. In this example we get the amount from the frontend. This can be accessed with data.amount. This is set by converting `inputLabel` from `functions.json` to lowercase.
- Import `bot` and `mcData` from `../main.js`.
- The `main` function should be defined and exported. This function is executed when the node runs.
- Use `try` and `catch` statements for error handling. If an error occurs, log it and rethrow it to ensure it can be caught elsewhere.

### 4. Update `functions.json`

In the `flow_functions` directory, open the `functions.json` file and add an entry for your new node:

```json
{
  "YOUR_NODE_NAME": {
    "name": "YOUR_NODE_NAME",
    "file": "YOUR_NODE_NAME.js",
    "id": "YOUR_NODE_NAME",
    "label": "DISPLAY NAME",
    "hasInput": true,
    "description": "YOUR NODE DESCRIPTION",
    "inputLabel": "Amount",
    "inputType": "number",
    "author": "YOUR NAME"
  }
}
```

**Replace the placeholders:**

- `YOUR_NODE_NAME` - The name of your node (in lowercase with underscores)
- `DISPLAY NAME` - The name displayed in the UI
- `YOUR NODE DESCRIPTION` - A description of what your node does
- `YOUR NAME` - Your GitHub username

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

Once youâ€™ve added your node and updated the `functions.json` file, push your changes to a new branch and open a pull request on GitHub.

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
git add .
git commit -m "Add custom node YOUR_NODE_NAME"
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

Go to the GitHub repository and create a pull request. Your changes will be reviewed, and if everything looks good, they will be merged!
