## How To Install üì•

### Docker üê≥ (Not recommended at the moment)

Using Docker at the moment is not recommended as it may be slower updated than the python version below.

If you have Docker installed, you can easily get Project Beehive up and running. Follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Pull the Docker image from the Docker Hub using the following command:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/the-lodestone-project/beehive:latest
```

After pulling the image, run the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/the-lodestone-project/beehive:latest
```

This command will start Project Beehive and map it to port 8000 on your local machine.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access the bot.
Please note that Docker must be installed and running on your machine to execute these steps. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Python üêç

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-lodestone-project/Beehive.git
```

3. Move to the new directory:

```bash
cd Beehive
```

4. Install all the dependencies using following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After cloning the repository and installing all the dependencies, run the python script with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This command will start Project Beehive and map it to port 8000 on your local machine.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access the bot.
